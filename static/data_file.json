Material was thin but soft, colors are not bad. Now I am true Petite L. 146 lb, 5\u2019 tall, in size. 36/38C/D, I wanted a shirt a little oversized. Based on other reviews I sized up to an XL. Mediums are usually just ok if petite is not available. THIS SHIRT WAS WAY SHORT IN THE BODY. And ridiculously long and big in the sleeves. yet slightly snug around the bust due to the drop shoulder cut. I send it back but with my sewing machine at hand I will try to adjust it and just wear it around the house.",

There was this weird super itchy tag in it on the side but you can fix that by cutting it off. This pullover is also super crinkly, but don't worry!! Hang it in the bathroom while you are taking your super duper hot shower that doesn't feel that hot to you but it definitely is and boom! No more wrinkles! It also fit a little bit smaller but to be fair, I comfortably wear extra large even though my size is a medium.",
